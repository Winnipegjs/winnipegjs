            <h2>Microsoft <3 JavaScript</h2>
			<p>
                Microsoft has been typically seen as this big, evil, restrictive, prescriptive company that is entirely
                anti-open source. But oh how the times have changed! Microsoft has embraced open source JavaScript frameworks
                as part of their web stack, improved tooling support to better support JavaScript, and even made available
                an object-oriented JavaScript library called TypeScript. In this session I'll walk you through the *new*
                Microsoft and show you how they're being good neighbors in the JavaScript community.

            <h2>Introduction to Angular and Breeze</h2>
            <p>
                Learn the fundamentals of AngularJS and watch as I build a sample application using AngularJS, Breeze.js,
                and Hot Towel all within Visual Studio!.NET.
