![PhoneGap](/images/phonegap-logo.png "PhoneGap")
Phonegap is a platform that bridges the shortcomings of standard mobile web and native applications. It provides a standard API and tools to produce a compiled native application, while still using Javascript as our language of choice.

Mobile device usage has grown at an incredible pace, both in developed and developing countries. The opportunities within this mobile space are huge, however, the fast differences between the environment and languages for each platform introduces many challenges. Mobile Web applications provide us with most of the tools and Phonegap gets us the rest of the way.

We will first discuss Mobile Web, see how far its come and see a simple demonstration of what it can do. Then, we will move onto Phonegap, what problems it solves, how it can be extended and some caveats of the platform.
